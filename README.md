# Svelte mouse parallax effect

This is a svelte example for a cursor parallax effect based on [this tutorial](https://medium.com/@PatrykZabielski/how-to-make-multi-layered-parallax-illustration-with-css-javascript-2b56883c3f27).

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.
